# Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification using Machine Learning
## Introduction
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer patients based on their medical data. The code explores three different models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Data Preparation
The dataset used for this project is the breast cancer dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information on 569 patients, including their cell features and diagnosis (benign or malignant).

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It is known for its ability to handle complex nonlinear relationships between data points. The code implements SVM using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the model.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is another supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks. It is simpler to implement than SVM and is often used as a baseline model for comparison. The code implements logistic regression using gradient descent to optimize the model parameters.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are a type of deep learning architecture that is particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. The code implements a CNN model to classify breast cancer patients based on their cell features represented as images.

## Performance Comparison
The code compares the performance of the three models using accuracy score. The CNN model achieves the highest accuracy of 98.1%, followed by SVM with 97.4% and logistic regression with 94.2%.

## Conclusion
Machine learning techniques, particularly CNNs, can be effectively applied to classify breast cancer patients with high accuracy. This has the potential to improve early detection and treatment of breast cancer, leading to better patient outcomes.

## Instructions
To run the code, please ensure you have the following libraries installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, tensorflow.keras. Then, save the code as a .py file and execute it using a Python interpreter.
